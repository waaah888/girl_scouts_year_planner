As your troop leader, I've put together a possible plan for the 2025-2026 school year, keeping your Junior (5th grade) and Cadette (8th grade) troops in mind. We'll aim for no more than two exciting outings per month, prioritizing events suitable for both age groups and staying within 60 miles of Mountain View, California. We've also made sure to skip any Award Q&A sessions!

Please note: While September's events are based on current listings, the events for October 2025 through June 2026 are hypothetical examples of activities that would fit our criteria, as detailed listings for those months are not yet available.
